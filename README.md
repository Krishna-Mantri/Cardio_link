# CardioLink

## Overview

CardioLink is a cutting-edge web application designed for the detection of cardiovascular disease anomalies using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. It collects real-time patient data via IoT devices, securely stores this data using Supabase, and generates comprehensive AI-driven reports to assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis and ongoing cardiac health monitoring.

## Features

- **Real-Time Patient Monitoring:** Collect live cardiovascular data seamlessly through IoT device integration.
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Utilize robust ML models to identify potential cardiovascular risks from real-time data.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Generate detailed and dynamic health reports automatically based on the analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize patient data through intuitive graphs and charts for easy interpretation.
- **Secure Data Management:** Employ Supabase backend for secure, scalable, and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Access and interact with the application easily through a responsive web platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, TypeScript
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase 
- **AI/ML Models:** Python
- **IoT Integration:** C programming
- **Build & Automation:** Makefile, Batchfile
